LED Swipe Lockdown Rules
Lock (aka stop) the moving LED using the left button. Your goal is to fill all 10 NeoPixels.

One light will swipe left to right, then right to left across the board. To lock the light in place and keep that LED on, the player must press the Left Button. Players can rest their play by pressing the right button.

The game has one level:
  Level 1: The swiping light is orange. The time they took to finish will be recorded in the serial monitor, so     players can see if they beat the game in a faster amount of time or not.
  The level ends when all 10 NeoPixels are successfully locked.

Rules:
  The player will lose if any of the following happen:
  The player presses a button while the light is on a NeoPixel thatâ€™s already locked (i.e., already lit).
  The player fails to lock in a light within 10 seconds of it swiping around
